I am currently a Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at the Chair of Information-Oriented Control (ITR), Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany, working with Professor [Sandra Hirche](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/hirche-sandra). From 2020 to 2022, I was a Postdoctoral researcher at the same Chair. In 2020, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Applied Mathematics (Systems and Control) from the University of Groningen, The Netherlands. My Ph.D. research was supervised by Professor [Harry Trentelman]() and Professor [Kanat Camlibel]().

<strong>Research Interest:</strong> 
My research lies at the interface of control, estimation, learning, and optimization of networked multi-agent systems, with applications in environmental monitoring, cyber-physical systems, and robotics. Specifically, my research interests include model-based control, data-driven control, learning-based control, robust and optimal control, distributed control and estimation, actuator and sensor scheduling.
